1. As a user, I want to be able to search for available bus routes, view schedules, and check seat availability to plan my journey. 
2. As a user, I want the option to filter and sort available buses based on criteria such as departure time, price, and duration to find the most convenient and cost-effective option. 
3. As a bus company administrator, I want to manage and update the bus schedule, including adding new routes, updating departure times, and marking buses as unavailable for certain dates.
4. 4. Ace bus company administrator, I want to monitor and manage seat occupancy for each bus, receiving alerts for fully booked buses and optimizing routes based on demand.
